# Scoring Rubrics: Knowledge & Content Dimensions (D1–D3)

## D1: Knowledge Delta (20 points) — THE CORE DIMENSION

The most important dimension. Does the Skill add genuine expert knowledge?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-5 | Explains basics Claude knows (what is X, how to write code, standard library tutorials) |
| 6-10 | Mixed: some expert knowledge diluted by obvious content |
| 11-15 | Mostly expert knowledge with minimal redundancy |
| 16-20 | Pure knowledge delta — every paragraph earns its tokens |

**Red flags** (instant score ≤5):
- "What is [basic concept]" sections
- Step-by-step tutorials for standard operations
- Explaining how to use common libraries
- Generic best practices ("write clean code", "handle errors")
- Definitions of industry-standard terms

**Green flags** (indicators of high knowledge delta):
- Decision trees for non-obvious choices ("when X fails, try Y because Z")
- Trade-offs only an expert would know ("A is faster but B handles edge case C")
- Edge cases from real-world experience
- "NEVER do X because [non-obvious reason]"
- Domain-specific thinking frameworks

**Evaluation questions**:
1. For each section, ask: "Does Claude already know this?"
2. If explaining something, ask: "Is this explaining TO Claude or FOR Claude?"
3. Count paragraphs that are Expert vs Activation vs Redundant

## D2: Mindset + Appropriate Procedures (15 points)

Does the Skill transfer expert **thinking patterns** along with **necessary domain-specific procedures**?

The difference between experts and novices isn't "knowing how to operate" — it's "how to think about the problem." But thinking patterns alone aren't enough when Claude lacks domain-specific procedural knowledge.

**Key distinction**:
| Type | Example | Value |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Thinking patterns** | "Before designing, ask: What makes this memorable?" | High — shapes decision-making |
| **Domain-specific procedures** | "OOXML workflow: unpack → edit XML → validate → pack" | High — Claude may not know this |
| **Generic procedures** | "Step 1: Open file, Step 2: Edit, Step 3: Save" | Low — Claude already knows |

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-3 | Only generic procedures Claude already knows |
| 4-7 | Has domain procedures but lacks thinking frameworks |
| 8-11 | Good balance: thinking patterns + domain-specific workflows |
| 12-15 | Expert-level: shapes thinking AND provides procedures Claude wouldn't know |

**What counts as valuable procedures**:
- Workflows Claude hasn't been trained on (new tools, proprietary systems)
- Correct ordering that's non-obvious (e.g., "validate BEFORE packing, not after")
- Critical steps that are easy to miss (e.g., "MUST recalculate formulas after editing")
- Domain-specific sequences (e.g., MCP server's 4-phase development process)

**What counts as redundant procedures**:
- Generic file operations (open, read, write, save)
- Standard programming patterns (loops, conditionals, error handling)
- Common library usage that's well-documented

**Expert thinking patterns look like**:
```markdown
Before [action], ask yourself:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this solve? Who uses it?
- **Constraints**: What are the hidden requirements?
- **Differentiation**: What makes this solution memorable?
```

**Valuable domain procedures look like**:
```markdown
### Redlining Workflow (Claude wouldn't know this sequence)
1. Convert to markdown: `pandoc --track-changes=all`
2. Map text to XML: grep for text in document.xml
3. Implement changes in batches of 3-10
4. Pack and verify: check ALL changes were applied
```

**Redundant generic procedures look like**:
```markdown
Step 1: Open the file
Step 2: Find the section
Step 3: Make the change
Step 4: Save and test
```

**The test**:
1. Does it tell Claude WHAT to think about? (thinking patterns)
2. Does it tell Claude HOW to do things it wouldn't know? (domain procedures)

A good Skill provides both when needed.

## D3: Anti-Pattern Quality (15 points)

Does the Skill have effective NEVER lists?

**Why this matters**: Half of expert knowledge is knowing what NOT to do. A senior designer sees purple gradient on white background and instinctively cringes — "too AI-generated." This intuition for "what absolutely not to do" comes from stepping on countless landmines.

Claude hasn't stepped on these landmines. It doesn't know Inter font is overused, doesn't know purple gradients are the signature of AI-generated content. Good Skills must explicitly state these "absolute don'ts."

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-3 | No anti-patterns mentioned |
| 4-7 | Generic warnings ("avoid errors", "be careful", "consider edge cases") |
| 8-11 | Specific NEVER list with some reasoning |
| 12-15 | Expert-grade anti-patterns with WHY — things only experience teaches |

**Expert anti-patterns** (specific + reason):
```markdown
NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like:
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial)
- Cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Default border-radius on everything
```

**Weak anti-patterns** (vague, no reasoning):
```markdown
Avoid making mistakes.
Be careful with edge cases.
Don't write bad code.
```

**The test**: Would an expert read the anti-pattern list and say "yes, I learned this the hard way"? Or would they say "this is obvious to everyone"?
